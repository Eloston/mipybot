MiPyBot goals
-------------

To-Do soon:
-Daemonize threads (?)
-Use queue module to reduce race conditions
-Split packet handlers to packet readers (reads raw bytes and returns useful data) and packet handlers (will process data returned from packet readers).
    -Implement using signals so the new packet handlers as well as plugins can get this data too

Near future:
-Read configuration file
    -Merge constants.py into config
    -Multiple configurations created by user
-GUI
    -Release v0.1 when at this stage(???)
-Text-based interface
    -GNU Screen like behavior?
    -Use domain sockets when avaliable and TCP otherwise
-Improved Plugin Management(?)
-Read more data from packets
-Friendly API for plugins
