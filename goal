MiPyBot goals
-------------

***IMPLEMENTED***

-Folder module for different protocol versions
    -Each protocol module name starts with v followed by the version number in decimal
    -In each protocol folder, the __init__.py script will contain the variables PROTOCOL_VERSION (the protocol version in decimal) and MINECRAFT_VERSION (the versions of Minecraft that support this protocol version)
    -There will be a packets folder that will contain packet handler code
        -Each packet handler will be in a separate file, and can be added/removed without changes to the code.
        -Each packet handler will have a send, process, and getlength functions.
        -Each packet handler will define which packet ID it deals with, so the packet processor will know which packet handler to send data to.

***TODO***

-Flexible user interface
    -A user can customize a robot base class parameters then create an object from that.
    -Multiple bots can be run at once (Using multi-threading).

-Modular bot script system (plugins)
    -Each script will be a separate file.
    -Each script can be loaded and unloaded at any time, unless by design it cannot.
    -There will be many functions that are relatively easy to learn and use in the scripting.

-Position pointer for packet data.
    -Combine getlength() and receive() together so it will be easier to modify and easier to manage and read
    -Define a read() statement to read data
        -Records position of data from the start
        -Returns the data read
        -Can take string types like "string" for a Minecraft string and "byte" for a Minecraft byte
