GETTING PYCRYPTO
================

***FOR LINUX USERS***

On Debian and Debian-like distributions, you will most likely find PyCrypto for Python 3 in your distribution's repository (On Debian it has).

Alternatively, you can build your own PyCrypto which is pretty easy and straight-forward

***FOR WINDOWS USERS***

You will probably not find the robot's specific version of PyCrypto for the robot's specific Python version from a 3rd party source easily, or at all. So following will be instructions on how to build PyCrypto on Windows and install it through different methods.

Prerequisites:
-Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2008 Express (not tested with earlier or later versions. However, more advanced editions are more likely to work)
    -If compiling a 64 bit edition, install the Windows 7 SDK (Which works for XP up) http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3138
-Python (It may have to be "registered" in the registry in order to work. The instructions will assume Python can be executed via executing "python" anywhere in CMD)

1. Unpack the source code from the source archive from the PyCrypto website. These instructions will refer to the PyCrypto build directory as %PYCRYPTO_BUILD%
2. Open a CMD window and follow these steps:
    2a. Run the command: set VS90COMNTOOLS=%PATH_TO_VISUAL_STUDIO_INSTALL%\Common7\Tools\
        (Where %PATH_TO_VISUAL_STUDIO_INSTALL% is the path to the Visual Studio install path, like C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\
    2b. Change your current working directory to %PATH_TO_VISUAL_STUDIO_INSTALL%\VC\bin (Use the cd command until you get there)
    2c. In the new current working directory, run one of the following:
        -vcvars32 for 32 bit
        -vcvars64 for 64 bit on a 64 bit host
        -vcvarsx86_amd64 for 64 bit cross compiling on a 32 bit host
        -vcvarsx86_ia64 for Itanium x64 cross compiling on a 32 bit host
    2d. Change your current working directory to %PYCRYPTO_BUILD%
    2e. Run the command: python setup.py bdist_wininst
3. An .exe installer should be created in %PYCRYPTO_BUILD%\dist which will install PyCrypto for your specific Python version.
